## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I learned that I need to get a better understanding of css overall. HTML, Javascript Ruby on Rails and React skills are good but I still need alot of improvement on CSS if want to be able to style the way I want to.


### Continued development

This was my first Frontend Mentor project and I really enjoyed it. It was a great way to kick off my 100 days of code, I definitely plan on doing alot more of these in the future.
